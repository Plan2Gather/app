## Linting and Formatting

We follow the [AirBnB style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) and use ESLint and Prettier for linting and formatting.

### Run ESLint

To run ESLint for linting your code, use the following command:

```bash
nx run-many -t lint
```

This command will lint all projects in your Nx workspace.

### Run Prettier

To run Prettier for code formatting, use the following command:

```bash
nx format
```

This command will format the code in all projects in your Nx workspace according to the Prettier configuration.

Make sure to have the necessary ESLint and Prettier configurations in place to maintain code consistency.

## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).
